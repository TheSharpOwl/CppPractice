# CppPractice
Just practicing some stuff in cpp xD

## What did I use :
I used VS 2019 and stdc++ latest (C++17 and C++20 both will work for sure).

## How to make it work:
* Put Boost include files in : ``Dependencies\include\boost`` (such that the .hpp files are inside ``\boost``) and create missing folders if they don't exist of course.
